.LI
X,Y,MASKS: Show the coordinates and layer stack of a certain point.
.P
After the selection of this command one may point at a certain position in
the PICT viewport.
A small cross subsequently appears at the closest grid point
and the coordinates corresponding to this grid point
are reported in the TEXT viewport.
This command is self-repeating; the coordinates of multiple grid points
can be retrieved without interruption.
Also the layer stack is displayed in the LAYER viewport after pointing
in the PICT viewport.
It shows the layers which are laying on that point.
Note that you can use the keyboard-keys to change the picture
while using the \fIx,y,masks\fP command,
for example zooming-in (i) or toggling dominant/transparent mode (D).
