This report and the application it describes is the result of a graduation
project. This graduation project has been performed for (and at) the Circuits
and Sytems group which is part of the faculty of Electrical Engineering at
Delft University of Technology.

Two important parts of this report are the design and implementation of the
architecture and a sort of a reference guide to the configuration file
language. Readers interested in the architecture of the application should read
at least Chapter \ref{chap:design}. Those more interested in the configuration
file language are referred to Chapter \ref{chap:language}.

Finally, I would like to thank dr. ir. Nick van der Meijs for his guidance,
opinions and advice during the project.
