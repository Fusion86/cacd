\chapter{Process Files}

This chapter lists the files that may be present in a process directory.
It is described briefly which information is contained by the file,
which tools are using it, and where more detailled information can be found.

Most of the process files can be created manually, using some text editor.
As an alternative, a graphical technology interface tool called \texttt{spock}
may be used to generate these files (see the manual page of \texttt{spock} 
for more details).
Further, some process files are generated by some dedicated tool
that is part of the software distribution.
