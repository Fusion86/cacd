\chapter{Introduction}

This document explains how new processes (or technologies) can 
be added in the design system.
Basically this document gives an overview of the process files
that are required and how they are organized.
For more details the document refers to other manuals and manual pages.

Note that to add process data to the system, you need
information about the process like mask names, mask gds numbers,
material resistances, material dimensions, transistor
models etc., depending on which tools you are going to use.
This information is typically provided by the 
organization/company via which you are going
to have your circuit fabricated.
