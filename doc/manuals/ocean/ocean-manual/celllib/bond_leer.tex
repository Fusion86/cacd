\subsection{bond\_leer}

Function: Bonding cell for small SoG circuits

Terminals: (vss, bf1, bf2, bf3, vdd, bf4, bf5, bf6)

Equivalent chip area: 800

Maximum size of embedded circuit: 350

Pins:
\begin{itemize}
\item
2 power pins (vss, vdd), which are already pre-connected to 
the internal power rails.
\item
6 user-configurable unbuffered pins.
\end{itemize}

Protection:\\ This bonding pattern is intended for use with a simple
8-pin fixed-probe card. The pins are {\em not} buffered and {\em not}
protected. Therefore the needles of the fixed-probe card should be
protected by diodes, otherwise the circuit blows up. With proper
diode protection, static charge is no problem. The output drive of
any arbitrary gate in the library turned out to be sufficient to
drive the input of the tester via a 1 meter cable.
