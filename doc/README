Be sure that variable ICDPATH is correctly set!
The ICDPATH is used to install the documents.
The variable TEXINPUTS is used for making tex manuals.
If your current working directory is "doc", for example,
you can set these environment variables as follows.
To check, type:

    echo $ICDPATH

If not ok, type:

    setenv ICDPATH `(cd ..; pwd)`

To set TEXINPUTS, type:

    setenv TEXINPUTS `pwd`/common:

The documents are installed in:

$ICDPATH/share/doc         (manuals, *.pdf)
$ICDPATH/share/doc/opman   (manuals/opmanual, *.pdf)
$ICDPATH/share/doc/howto   (howto, *.txt)
$ICDPATH/share/doc/memos   (memos, *.txt)
$ICDPATH/share/doc/notes   (notes, *.pdf)
