Subject: Use of putdevmod for xsls.

Putdevmod is used, to put a device cell in the circuit view of the database.
In it is only a "spicemod" description allowed?

For example:

device nenh2
begin spicemod
* terminals d g s
* bulk 0
* prefix m
end

However, this terminal order is also used for xsls, while intended for xspice.
There is no possibility to define another order for xsls.
The order for xsls must be:

* terminals g d s

The only way to map a "nenh2" transistor to a "nenh", is by using the
xsls control file (xslsrc).

For example:

% cat xslsrc
model xxx nenh2 nenh ()
model yyy penh2 penh ()

For xspice, the following control file mapping must be used:

% cat xspicerc
model xxx nenh2 nmos ()
model yyy penh2 pmos ()

By xspice, the names "xxx" and "yyy" are used on each device record in the netlist.
Maybe putdevmod is not needed, because in the control file the following items
can be defined:

# long_prefix
prefix nenh2 m
prefix penh2 m
params nenh2 { ... }
params penh2 { ... }
bulk nmos 0
bulk pmos 5

No different bulk voltages for each device can be defined and
maybe also not a good choice by trying that with putdevmod.
