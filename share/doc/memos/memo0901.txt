Subject: Net coordinates by backannotation

See "src/space/lump/out.c":

Private void outNode (node_t *n)
{
    ...

    if (optBackInfo) {
	if (n -> names && !n -> names -> instName)
	    addCoorXY (buf, n -> names -> x, n -> names -> y);
	else
	    addCoorXY (buf, n -> node_x, n -> node_y);
    }

    ...
}

The coordinates of a net are not always equal to the node x,y coordinates.
The node x,y coordinates are the coordinates of the first x,y point.
The lowest x position and at that position the lowest y position.
Thus there can be lower y positions at higher x positions.

The coordinates of the complete net are only outputted, when the net has no
n->names. Only in that case you can know the lowest x,y coordinates in the net.

When the net has n->names (it does no matter what for name it is), then the
x,y coordinates of that name are taken. It can happen, that this name is not
used for the net head, because it is the name of a sub-cell instance or
the net name is based on parameter "net_pos_name" or a group name with
group separator and index is used.

Q: When is a group name with group separator and index used?
A: By resistance extraction, when a node group has more than one node,
   can the group name only be in one of the nodes of the group.
   The other nodes of the group gets a special generated group name.

Q: What can be a group name?
A: Default, only the first label found is taken as group name.
   That is the label with lowest coordinates.
   In case there are long and short labels, then the first short
   label is used (that is a label of the extracted cell).
   By using parameter "term_is_netname" also terminals of the extracted
   cell in the group are used for the group name.
   The first terminal/label is used (equal preference).

When a terminal or label is in the net, then the x,y coordinates of the
first terminal/label is chosen.
Thus the x,y coordinates printed does not always belong to the head net.
Thus, the x,y coordinates of the head label/terminal are lost.
This, because terminals and labels have equal preference in n->names.
The x,y coordinates of the first terminal/label found in n->names is used.
However, n->names is pourly sorted (not on coordinates).
Thus the coordinates taken, are not always the lowest coordinates.
And in case it is sorted on coordinates, then there can be lower coordinates,
because terminals of instances can have lower coordinates.

Because in the above code only the first node name is examend, therefor the
names must be in certain order, because if there is a terminal/label then
it must be in the front of any connected names with an instance name.

Thus, in the case there is a terminal/label, the node x,y coordinates
are lost and not used for backannotation.
Therefor it is maybe better not to output a terminal/label as the first net.

In the circuit/mc stream there are x,y coordinates for every element/device/subcell.

In the circuit/term stream there are no x,y coordinates.
Maybe the x,y coordinates of terminals can also be put there.

In the circuit/net stream there are no x,y coordinates for all sub-nets.
Only the sub-nets of the node "names" list are outputted with x,y coordinates.
Also the terminals of subcells.
However, the pins/ports of elements/devices are not outputted with x,y coordinates.
Maybe it is possible to give each net-equivalence also a x,y coordinate.
