# directory: demo/FreePDK45/ringosc

The ringosc.gds file of this demo was generated by Lin Li.
The file contains the handcrafted layout of a ring-oscillator.
The ring-oscillator was build using 9 INV_X2 basic cells
from the NangateOpenCellLibrary.
See also the "suboscil" demo.

This demo shows the netlist extraction of a ring-oscillator
using the FreePDK45 technology.

STEPS
=====

1.  Change this directory into a NangateOpenCellLibrary project.
    It assumes that the NangateOpenCellLibrary is installed.
    % mkpr -u ../NangateOpenCellLibrary .

2.  To use the NangateOpenCellLibrary project, it must be added
    to the local project list:
    % addproj ../NangateOpenCellLibrary

3.  We want to use all basic cells of the NangateOpenCellLibrary.
    Thus we import all these cells in our project.
    % impcell -lc -a ../NangateOpenCellLibrary

4.  Use cgi to put the processor layout into the database.
    % cgi ringosc.gds

5.  Use dali to show the layout of the ring-oscillator.
    % dali ringosc

6.  Compiling the local space technology file before usage.
    % tecc space.def.s

7.  Perform a flat netlist extraction of the ring-oscillator layout.
    % space -Fv -E space.def.t -P space.def.p ringosc

8.  To show a SPICE netlist of the result, type:
    % xspice -a ringosc

9.  Overrule the default cell status of the INV_X2 basic cell.
    % xcontrol -regular INV_X2

10. Perform a netlist extraction to the transistor level.
    % space -Fv -E space.def.t -P space.def.p ringosc

11. Show the resulting SPICE netlist.
    % xspice -au ringosc

12. Perform a netlist extraction with 2D capacitances.
    % space -Fv -Cl -E space.def.t -P space.def.p ringosc

13. Perform an analog spice simulation on this netlist.
    % simeye

14. Perform a 3D capacitances extraction and analog simulation.
    % space3d -Fv -C3 -E space.def.t -P space.def.p ringosc

15. Show the 3D Boundary Element Mesh of the 3D extraction.
    % Xspace -C3 -E space.def.t -P space.def.p ringosc

16. Perform an accurate substrate resistance extraction to
    show the possible substrate noise on the "sens" pin.
    % space3d -Fv -Cl -B -E space.def.t -P space.def.p ringosc

17. Idem, but now for the layout with a ground shield.

18. Demonstration of subresgen tool.

19. Performing a 2D substrate resistance extraction and
    analog spice simulation to analyse the substrate noise.
