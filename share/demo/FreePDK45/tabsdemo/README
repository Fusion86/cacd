# directory: demo/FreePDK45/tabsdemo

Demonstration of flat space extractions of a counter cell
made with the FreePDK45 process and the use of the tabs tool.

STEPS
=====

1.  Change this directory into a NangateOpenCellLibrary project.
    It assumes that the NangateOpenCellLibrary is installed.
    % mkpr -u ../NangateOpenCellLibrary .

2.  To use the NangateOpenCellLibrary project, it must be added
    to the local project list:
    % addproj ../NangateOpenCellLibrary

3.  To use the basic cells, they must be imported:
    % impcell -lc -a ../NangateOpenCellLibrary

4.  Unpack the counter layout gds2 file and make a hierarchical
    layout cell listing:
    % cgi c23.gds
    % dblist -h c23

5.  Inspect the layout with the layout editor dali:
    % dali c23

6.  Compile the local space technology file:
    % tecc space.def.s

7.  Perform a flat netlist extraction of the counter:
    % space -Fv -E space.def.t -P space.def.p c23

8.  Inspect the extraction result in SLS format:
    % xsls c23

9.  Perform a logic simulation with the sls simulator:
    % simeye

10. Use xcontrol to change the library status of some basic cells:
    % xcontrol -regular AND2_X1 AND3_X1 DFF_X1 MUX2_X1 OR2_X1

11. Perform a flat netlist extraction of the counter again:
    % space -Fv -E space.def.t -P space.def.p c23

12. Inspect the extraction result in SPICE format:
    % xspice -auo c23

13. Use tabs to add 2D capacitance data to the technology file:
    % tabs -s space.def.s

14. Perform a flat netlist extraction of the counter with 2D
    capacitances and show the SPICE netlist:
    % space -Fv -Cl -E space.def.t -P space.def.p c23
    % xspice -auo c23
