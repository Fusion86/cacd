The NangateOpenCellLibrary.gds file is downloaded from the Nangate Resource Center.
Two cells are modified (DFFRS_X1 and DFFRS_X2), because they had duplicated terminals.
For installation, run the "install.sh" script (type "./install.sh" or "sh install.sh").

The Nangate 45nm Open Cell Library is an open-source, standard-cell library
provided for the purposes of testing and exploring EDA flows.

Nangate has developed and donated this library to si2.org for open use.
The library is intended to aid university research programs and organizations
such as Si2 in developing flows, developing circuits and exercising new algorithms.
The library was generated using Nangate's Library Creator(TM) and the 45nm FreePDK
Base Kit from North Carolina State University (NCSU).

FreePDK is an effort to develop an open-source, Open-Access-based PDK for the 45nm
technology node and the Predictive Technology Model (PTM).
