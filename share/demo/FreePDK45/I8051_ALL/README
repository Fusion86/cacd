# directory: demo/FreePDK45/I8051_ALL

The I8051_ALL.gds file of this demo was generated by Lin Li.
The file contains the layout of a 8051 processor.
The VHDL code of this processor was taken from
    http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~dalton/i8051/i8051syn/

Lin Li has synthesized it with Synopsys and did the
placement and routing with Cadence Encounter.
After that he has generated the GDSII output file.

This demo shows the extraction of the 8051 processor
to the basic cell nivo.  The result can be netlisted.
For example a SLS or VHDL netlist can be made.

STEPS
=====

1.  Change this directory into a NangateOpenCellLibrary project.
    It assumes that the NangateOpenCellLibrary is installed.
    % mkpr -u ../NangateOpenCellLibrary .

2.  To use the NangateOpenCellLibrary project, it must be added
    to the local project list:
    % addproj ../NangateOpenCellLibrary

3.  We want to use all basic cells of the NangateOpenCellLibrary.
    Thus we import all these cells in our project.
    % impcell -lc -a ../NangateOpenCellLibrary

4.  Use cgi to put the processor layout into the database.
    Don't use the default basic mask list, but "bmlist3.gds".
    % cgi I8051_ALL.gds -m bmlist3.gds

5.  Use dali to show the layout of the I8051 processor.
    % dali I8051_ALL

6.  Perform a flat netlist extraction of the I8051 layout.
    % space -F I8051_ALL

7.  To show a VHDL netlist of the result, type:
    % xvhdl I8051_ALL
