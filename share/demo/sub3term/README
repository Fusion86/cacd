# directory: demo/sub3term

Demonstration of substrate resistance extraction using the option -B.
From the section "Examples" in the "Space Substrate Resistance
Extraction User's Manual".

STEPS
=====

1.  Make project, use "scmos_n" technology and lambda = 0.1 (micron)
    % mkpr -p scmos_n -l 0.1 projectname

Rest assumes that you and your files are in the project directory.

2.  Use cgi to put "sub3term" layout into the database.
    % cgi sub3term.gds

3.  Use e.g. the layout editor dali to inspect the layout.
    % dali sub3term
    (Click on "-quit-" in the menu to exit the program.)

4.  Compile the element definition file.
    % tecc elem.s

5.  Perform an extraction of cell sub3term in batch mode.
    Extract substrate resistances using option -B.
    % space3d -v -E elem.t -P param.p -B sub3term
    Or perform an interactive extraction of cell sub3term.
    % Xspace -E elem.t -P param.p
    (Click button "sub3term" in the menu "Database", click button 
    "3D sub. res." in the menu "Options", click button "DrawBEMesh" 
    and "DrawGreen" in the menu "Display", and click "extract" in 
    the menu "Extract".  Click "quit" in menu "Extract" or hotkey 'q'
    to exit the Xspace program.)

    Optionally, use Xspace in special prepass mode (after space3d)
    to view the substrate boundary element mesh and the Green functions
    calculated between the points in the mesh (not doing an extraction).
    % Xspace -%1 -E elem.t -P param.p sub3term
    (Click button "3D sub. res." in the menu "Options", click button
    "DrawBEMesh" and "DrawGreen" in the menu "Display", and click "extract"
    in the menu "Extract" or hotkey 'e'.)

6.  Inspect the spice description of the extracted circuit.
    % xspice -a sub3term
