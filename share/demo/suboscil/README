Demonstration of substrate resistance extraction using the option -b.
From the section "Examples" in the Space Substrate Resistance
Extraction User's Manual.

STEPS
=====

1.  Make project, use scmos_n technology and lambda = 0.1 (micron)
    % mkpr -p scmos_n -l 0.1 projectname

Rest assumes that you and your files are in the project directory.

2.  Use cgi to put oscil layout into the database.
    % cgi oscil.gds

3.  Use e.g. the layout editor dali to inspect the layout.
    % dali oscil
    (Click on "DB_menu", then on "all_exp", then on "maximum".
     Click on "-return-" and "-quit-" to exit the program.)

4.  Perform an extraction of cell oscil in batch mode.
    Extract substrate resistances and coupling capacitances.
    % space3d -vF -P param.p -bC oscil
    Or perform an interactive extraction of cell oscil.
    % Xspace -P param.p
    (Click button "oscil" in the menu "Database", click button
    "inter. sub. res." and "coupling cap." in the menu "Options",
    click button "DrawSubTerm" and "DrawSubResistor" in the menu
    "Display", and click "extract" in the menu "Extract".
    Click button "quit" in menu "Extract" to exit the program.)

5.  Inspect the spice description of the extracted circuit.
    % xspice -a oscil

6.  If you have spice available, perform a spice simulation using simeye
    (check the shell script nspice in $ICDPATH/share/bin to see if spice
     is called correctly).
    % simeye
    (Click on the "Simulate" menu and choice item "Prepare".
     Select in the "Circuit:" field cell name "oscil" and
     in the "Stimuli:" field file name "oscil.cmd".
     Choice simulation "Type: spice" and click on button "Run".
     To leave the program, choice item "Exit" in the "File" menu.)

7.  Perform an extraction of cell oscil in batch mode.
    Extract now substrate resistances using BEM method.
    % space3d -vF -P param.p -BC oscil
    or
    % tecc tech.s
    % space3d -vF -P param.p -E tech.t -BC oscil
    (both circuit extractions must be equal)
    Perform also an interactive extraction:
    % Xspace -P param.p -E tech.t -BC oscil
    (Click button "DrawBEMesh", "DrawSubTerm" and "DrawSubResistor" in
    the menu "Display", and use hotkey "e" to "extract".
    Use hotkey "i" to zoom-in on cursor position and the arrow-keys to
    pan around. Use hotkey "o" to zoom-out and "b" to set bounding-box
    view again. Use hotkey "q" to exit the program.)
    You see 19 substrate contact terminals, but each has a very
    fine boundary element mesh (BE-mesh).

8.  We do step 7 again, but now using another technology file.
    % diff tech.s tech2.s
    We have changed @gnd into @sub. Each @sub generates substrate
    contact terminal areas. Compile this technology file.
    % tecc tech2.s
    We use also another parameter file "param2.p".
    We have set parameter "sep_sub_term" to "on", because we want
    separate substrate terminals for the poly and metal areas (else
    everything is merged). Because we are now using a very large
    substrate area, we must reduce the number of BE elements (else
    the calculation costs too much time). Thus, we use a default
    "edge_be_ratio" and a "max_be_area" of "10" micron^2.
    We are also using a smaller "be_window" size of "4" micron.
    Perform an extraction of cell oscil in batch mode:
    % space3d -vF -P param2.p -E tech2.t -BC oscil
    Perform also an interactive extraction:
    % Xspace -P param2.p -E tech2.t -BC oscil
    (Use directly "e" to "extract", the parameter file contains
    the other needed settings to get a nice picture.)
    Note that a "-b" extraction does not work, because at this moment
    the program makedela cannot handle these substrate areas laying
    against each other.
    Note that you can also make the substrate terminals distributed.
    Then you get more separate substrate terminal areas. But this
    works only for -B in combination with interconnect res extraction.
    And the causing conductors must have a high-ohmic sheet res value.
    Set parameter "low_sheet_res" to "0" ohm to make all conductors
    high-ohmic (note that conductor "cwn" cannot be set high-ohmic,
    because it has a zero sheet res value).
    Perform the extraction with distributed interconnect res:
    % space3d -vF -P param2.p -E tech2.t -BCr oscil
    You see that there are a lot more substrate terminals.
    Perform also an interactive extraction:
    % Xspace -P param2.p -E tech2.t -BCr oscil
    (After you have done "e" to "extract", put button "DrawBEMesh"
    off to see only the substrate terminals with there borders.
    You don't need to extract again. Use hotkey "a" to view the
    display output file again, but with-out the mesh. %-)
