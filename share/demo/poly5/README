Demonstration of 3D capacitance extraction for 5 parallel conductors.
From the section "Examples" in the Space 3D Capacitance Extraction User's 
Manual.

STEPS
=====

1.  Make project, use scmos_n technology and lambda = 0.05 (micron)
    % mkpr -p scmos_n -l 0.05 projectname

Rest assumes that you and your files are in the project directory.

2.  Use cgi to put the poly5 layout into the database.
    % cgi poly5.gds

3.  Compile element definition file.
    % tecc tech.s

4.  Perform an extraction of cell poly5 in batch mode
    % space3d -C3 -E tech.t -P param.p poly5
    or interactively
    % Xspace -E tech.t -P param.p 
    (Click button "poly5" in the menu "Database",
    click button "coupling cap" and "3D capacitance" in the menu "Options",
    click button "DrawBEMesh", "DrawGreen" and "3 dimensional" in the
    menu "Display", and click button "extract" in the menu "Extract".
    Click on button "quit" in menu "Extract" to exit the Xspace program.)

5.  Inspect the extracted circuit.
    % xspice -a poly5
