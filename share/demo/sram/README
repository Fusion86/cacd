Demonstration of 3D capacitance extraction for a static RAM cell.
From the section "Examples" in the Space 3D Capacitance Extraction User's 
Manual.

STEPS
=====

1.  Make project, use scmos_n technology and lambda = 0.25 (micron)
    % mkpr -p scmos_n -l 0.25 projectname

Rest assumes that you and your files are in the project directory.

2.  Use cgi to put sram layout into the database.
    % cgi sram.gds

3.  Compile element definition file.
    % tecc sram.s

4.  Perform an extraction of cell sram in batch mode
    % space3d -C3 -E sram.t -P sram.p sram
    or interactively
    % Xspace -E sram.t -P sram.p
    (Click button "sram" in the menu "Database",
    click button "coupling cap" and "3D capacitance" in the menu "Options",
    click button "DrawBEMesh", "DrawGreen" and "3 dimensional" in the
    menu "Display", and click button "extract" in the menu "Extract".
    Click button "quit" in menu "Extract" to exit the Xspace program.)

5.  Inspect the extracted circuit.
    % xspice -a sram
