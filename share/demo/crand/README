# directory: demo/crand

Demonstration of (1) extraction of a random counter circuit
and (2) switch-level simulation of the circuit.

STEPS
=====

1.  Make project, use scmos_n technology and lambda = 0.2 (micron)
    % mkpr -p scmos_n -l 0.2 projectname

Rest assumes that you and your files are in the project directory.

2.  Use cgi to put crand layout into the database.
    % cgi crand.gds

3.  Perform a flat extraction of cell crand, also extract ground 
    capacitances.
    % space -vFc crand

4.  Start simeye.
    % simeye &
    Click on the "Simulate" menu and choice the "Prepare" item.
    Select in the "Circuit:" field cell name "crand" and
    in the "Stimuli:" field file name "crand.cmd" (click on it).
    To inspect or edit the input signals, click on the "Edit" button.

5.  Running a sls simulation.
    Go back to the "Simulate -> Prepare" dialog and choice
    simulation "Type: sls-timing" and for "Read: Analog".
    Perform a switch-level timing simulation by clicking button
    "Run" and watch the simulation results.
