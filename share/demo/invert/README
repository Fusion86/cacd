# directory: demo/invert

Demonstration of extraction of an inverter with transistor bulk 
connections and drain/source regions.  The latter are extracted as 
either non-linear junction capacitances, or drain/source area and 
perimeter information attached to the MOS transistors.

STEPS
=====

1.  Make project, use scmos_n technology and lambda = 0.2 (micron)
    % mkpr -p scmos_n -l 0.2 projectname

Rest assumes that you and your files are in the project directory.

2.  Use cgi to put invert layout into database.
    % cgi invert.gds

3.  Perform an extraction of the circuit, including coupling capacitances.  
    The drain/source regions are extracted as non-linear junction capacitances
    that have parameters 'area' and 'perimeter'.
    % space -C -Sjun_caps=area-perimeter invert

4.  Look in the file xspicerc to see how the junction capacitances are
    printed in the netlist output as diodes with parameters 'area' and 
    'pj', and next get the SPICE circuit description.
    % xspice -a invert

5.  An alternative is to extract the drain/source regions as 'area and 
    perimeter' information that is attached to the MOS transistors.
    This achieved by modifying the transistor definitions in the element
    definition file.  Therefore, first copy the element definition file
    from the process directory to the local file elem.s:
    % cp $ICDPATH/share/lib/process/scmos_n/space.def.s elem.s
    % chmod +w elem.s

    Change the lines 
       nenh : cpg caa  csn : cpg caa : @sub  # nenh MOS
       penh : cpg caa !csn : cpg caa : cwn   # penh MOS
    into
       nenh : cpg caa  csn : cpg caa (!cpg caa csn)  : @sub # nenh MOS
       penh : cpg caa !csn : cpg caa (!cpg caa !csn) : cwn  # penh MOS
    to describe the drain/source regions.

    Change the lines
       cond_pa : caa !cpg !csn : caa  : 70  : p    # p+ active area
       cond_na : caa !cpg  csn : caa  : 50  : n    # n+ active area
    into
       cond_pa : caa !cpg !csn : caa  : 0   : p    # p+ active area
       cond_na : caa !cpg  csn : caa  : 0   : n    # n+ active area
    to avoid complaints by tecc about the fact the resistance for drain/
    source regions should be zero (that resistance is already modeled in 
    the transistor model).

    And remove the 'ndif' and 'pdif' capacitance lists.

    Next, run tecc to compile the new element definition file:
    % tecc elem.s
    and run space again with the new element definition file.
    % space -C -Sjun_caps=area-perimeter -E elem.t invert
    
6.  Next watch the SPICE output again.
    % xspice -a invert
