# Space CACD
The Space project was carried out by the Circuits and Systems group of the
department of Electrical Engineering at the Delft University of Technology,
the Netherlands.  See the Space website: http://www.space.tudelft.nl

The main topic of the project was the layout-to-circuit extractor 'space'.
Therefor, the distribution was called "the Space CACD software".

This distribution includes also the NELSIS IC design tools and the OCEAN Sea-of-Gate
placement and routing software.  And the TU Delft design practicum software.
And a version of the Berkeley SPICE analogue network simulator.

This source distribution is intended only to be used with Linux.
