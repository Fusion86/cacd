INTRODUCTION

This file describes how to (semi automatically) determ sls
transistor model parameters for a particular process.
The method is based on the report "Determination of SLS
transistor model parameters" by A.J. Schooneveld,
Delft University of Technology, May 1987.


TOOLS AND FILES USED

The following tools and files support the determination of
the sls transistor model file.
(The files that are called NAME_ex - where NAME is a string
of characters - are example files for the actual data files
used.)

(1) A libary of parameterized circuits according to the
    test circuits as described in "Determination of SLS
    transistor model parameters" by A.J. Schooneveld.
    (Note: The libary currently only contains CMOS circuits).

(2) A file 'models' with appropriate spice transistor models
    for the current process (see the example file 'models_ex').

(3) The circuit simulator 'spice'.

(4) For each desired pair of transistor <width and length>:
    a parameter file describing how to generate the actual
    set of test circuits from the library circuits (see
    the example file 'values_ex').
    These files have to be determined experimentally !!!
    (see "how to proceed").

(5) The unix shell script 'dospice' that instantiates a
    particular cell from the library and runs spice.

(6) The program 'delay' that finds the delay time from
    a spice output file.

(7) The unix shell script 'resis' that extracts the drain
    source current and the drain source voltage from a spice
    output file.

(8) The program 'solve' that solves (for a particular
    transistor width and length) the sls transistor model
    parameters.

(9) A file 'header' that contains a header for the sls
    transistor model file (see the example 'header_ex').

(10) A file 'offsets' that contains the offset values for the
     length and width of the sls transistor models (see
     'offsets_ex').

(11) The unix shell script 'collect' that collects (for each
     different transistor width and length) the output of
     'solve', and that assembles the final slsmod file.


INSTALLATION

After installation of the software, first go to the directory
'slsmodgen/src' and type 'make install'.
Then, add to your Unix path variable the directory 'slsmodgen/bin'.


HOW TO PROCEED

When determining the sls transistor model file for a particular
process it is best to create special directory for the process:

$ mkdir proc
$ cd proc

In this directory a file called 'models' should be placed that
contains spice transistor models (see models_ex').

Then, for each desired pair <transistor width and length> for
which transistor parameters have to be determined do:

(a) Make a sub directory and go to that directory.

    $ mkdir wid_len
    $ cd wid_len

(b) Construct a parameter file as in 'values_ex'.

    $ vi values

    This file is a unix shell script that contains the
    variables that determine the actual form of the test
    circuits used and that contains calls to 'dospice'
    to actually generate the test circuits and run spice
    on them.

(c) Execute the above shell script.

    $ sh values

(d) Run the program 'solve' to solve the sls transistor
    model parameters.

    $ solve values > solved

    The delay values found should all be larger than zero.
    (Inspect this in the output of the program 'solve'.)
    If not, the appropriate variables should be adjusted
    and the spice simulations (for the relevant circuits)
    have to be excuted again.
    (This process is usually repeated several times before
    the final result is obtained.)


Then, if correct parameters have been determined for all
<width and length> pairs, return to the directory <proc>,
create a header file for the sls transistor model file
(see header_ex)

$ vi header

create a correct 'offsets' file (see 'offsets_ex')

$ vi offsets

and obtain the final slsmod file by running the program
collect as in the example script 'docol_ex':

collect \
2.4_1.6/solved \
6_1.6/solved \
20_1.6/solved \
 > slsmod
