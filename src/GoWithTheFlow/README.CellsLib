Take care that when something changes with the cell library (in this tree),
files in sim_libs and synth_libs have to be updated and the
scripts
    sim_libs/mk_CellsLib,
    synth_libs/mk_CellsLib and
    synth_libs/mk_db
have to be executed (first set the correct paths for the
simulator and/or synthesiser).

If OPPROGPATH is not "/data/public/common/software/opprog" then
also a new install must be done (see README.install)
