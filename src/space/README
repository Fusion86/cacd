This is a port of the Public Domain version of space.

A number of items are removed from these space sources.
I want to keep the sources as simple as possible (SdeG).

Functions pp1SetColors() and pp1ResetColors() are not yet removed
from "extract/gettech.c". This functions are only used by space3d.
See "scan/sp_main.c" Only by option -B (optSubRes).
And only if optSubResInternal is set. In that case program "makesubres"
is not called, but an internal prepass is done to use green and schur
to process the 3D substrate. This is only needed to display results
of this prepass by tool Xspace (makesubres can't do this).
Of coarse it makes the source code more difficult to understand.
You must know that normally only cap3D is processed by space3d itself
in the extract pass (and can be displayed).
Note that the special sub3D prepass must use a different color scheme.

I removed parameter "sub3d.old_mesh" and variable optSubResOldMesh.

I removed define "#ifdef OTHER_EPI"
This also removes parameter "moments.r_epi" and variable RCtime.
This seems to be experimental stuff.

I removed define "#ifdef NET_TERM_MODE" and "#ifdef NO_CORE_MODE"
Also removed variables optGenNetTerm, optReadNetTerm, optNoCore.
Also removed functions initInstNr(), endInstNr(), findInstNr().
Also removed parameter "write_net_term" (no write of stream "netterm").
Also removed parameter "read_net_term" (no write of stream "nethier").
Also removed noSubnodeJoin, HasCore, coreBitmask, setCoreBitMask, core_l/_r.

Not removed define "#ifdef DMS_TERM_POS" (see "lump/out.c").
This shows how possibly stream "termpos" can be written.

Not removed code to use corner_nodes (see "icddoc notes/an1405.pdf").
Variables corner_line_node, use_corner_ratio, node_h/_w.
Parameters "use_corner_nodes" and "use_corner_ratio".
Note that parameter "equi_line_ratio" must be specified.

Not removed code to join contacts.
Variable join_contacts and parameter "join_contacts".
Note: auto enabled by use of corner_nodes.
