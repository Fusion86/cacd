/*
 * ROUTER DESIGN RULES for Delft NMOS process
 *
 * Patrick Groeneveld 10-1987
 *
 * This file describes the design rules which
 * are (only) used by the plar-programs 'glroute', 'sequ'
 * and 'gcr'. These programs fetch the data they need
 * from this file. Everything they do not reqocnize
 * will be ignored without warning. The programs
 * start looking for this file in the project directory.
 * If no 'Route_rules' -file was found there, the
 * route_rules file in ~cacd/lib/process/xxxx will be
 * used. In this way the user can set his/her own
 * router design rules by placing this file in
 * the project directory.
 * See also: GCR users manual
