   Downloaded specs from mosis site (n83r.prm) and updated maskdata,
space.def.s, epslay. Compiled with

   tecc -m maskdata -p scmos-orb-2.0nwell space.def.s

   Changed the space.def.s file again - correcting the contact
resistances. MOSIS specs gives resistance per minimum size contact
while space wants resistance per 1 um^2. Multipled the values
given by MOSIS by 16.
