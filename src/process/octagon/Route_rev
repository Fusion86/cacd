/* * *    ROUTER DESIGN RULES for C3TU process  * * *
 * Route_rev
 * This is the design rule file read ONLY by gcr for the

 * to sequ.
 * The syntax is the same as for Route_rules.
 *
 * gcr is 'fooled' by flipping the poly and the metal layer.
 * terminals may only be present in the vertical layer
 * specified by the normal 'Route_rules' file.
 * poly AND metal2 was mapped to metal1
 * metal1 was mapped to the vertical layer
