		       About the cell library "bonding"
		       ================================

This library contains the bonding patterns for the fishbone chip.  It currently
contains seven cells which which are useful for finishing the design at the
highest level. To place the design on the final chip, these bonding patterns fit
presisely to make a multi-project chip (in library 'chip').

The bonding cells span up the area for the design. They also specify the exact
terminal locations.

The cell 'bond_leer' is used by the students to place their exercise cell in.
They have to finish the name of the group in the upper parts.  Each 'bond_leer'
should be isolated from its neighbours. To enforce this there are in/ins (=
metal1 and metal2) borders around the cell. The repetition of the 'bond_leer'
cell on the final chip should be [136,84] grid points.

These subciruits can be placed in the chip. The result should be the
following hierarchical tree:
