###  To Edit This File:  The contents of this file are used by the "make"
###	command, and follow the syntax rules for Unix "make".  Long lines
###	can be split by placing a '\' at the end of one line and
###	continuing on the following line.  If you have any quote marks
###	or other special shell "metacharacters" they should be escaped
###	via a backslash.  Variables identified below as text strings will be
###	quoted, so quote marks are not normally required (in fact they
###	may be confusing).
###
###	If you get the error "make: syntax error at line nnn", it is likely
###	that you made an error in this file or the system specific file.
###	The most common error is to forget to continue a line with the '\'.
###
###	Comments, such as this, start at the beginning of a line with '#'
###	and stop at the end of a line.  When changing the following values
###	you should save the original values by inserting '#' at the beginning
###	of the line.
###
###	The definitions below are group in to four areas:
###
###		1.  Directory organization.  These definitions tell where
###			to store the final executables, data files, and
###			intermediate (".o") files.
###
###		2.  X11 options.  These definitions are provided to
###			accommodate X11 if it is not installed with
###			the regular system software.
###
###		3.  Compiler/System options.  You will want to leave most if
###			not all of these as they are; any exceptions should
###			probably be put in a per-system file.
###
###		4.  SPICE configuration options.  These definitions indicate
###			what goes in to your version of spice.
###

###	Directory Organization
###
###
#       TOP0 was the distribution directory.
#	TOP0 was normally set during the build with the 'pwd' command.
#	Note that we don't use this absolute path anymore.
#	We now only use relative paths in the make procedure.
#	Also we don't use variables DIST_DIR, SYS_DIR and OBJ_TOP anymore.
#	Also we keep the ".o" files next to the corresponding ".c" files.

#	"SPICE_LIB_DIR" and "SPICE_EXEC_DIR" are the locations for
#	data files and executable programs, respectively.
#
SPICE_LIB_DIR	= $(ICDPATH)/share/lib/spice3
SPICE_EXEC_DIR	= $(ICDPATH)/bin

###	Compiler/System options
###
###
#	CC is your C compiler
CC = gcc

#	CC_OPT: Default compile options (optimization/debug level, other)
#CC_OPT		= -O2
CC_OPT		= -O
#CC_OPT		= -O -Wall

#	CC_OPT_SAFE: Special compile options to override CC_OPT for code
#	which typically causes problems for most compilers (bsim1 and bsim2).
#	CC_OPT_SAFE defaults to CC_OPT, so you normally won't have to put
#	in anything here (unless your compiler gives up on you for
#	bsim1 or bsim2).  (This should probably be put in the system specific
#	file but I want to document it here.)
#
#	CC_OPT_SAFE	= -g
#	SYS_CFLAGS	= -DSTATIC
#
CC_OPT_SAFE	= $(CC_OPT)
CFLAGS		= $(CC_OPT) $(SYS_CFLAGS)

#	INCLUDE is used after CFLAGS in the used CC commands.
#	We like to use a relative path to this spice3 "include" directory.
#	It is correctly set in each "makedefs" file.
#	Thus we don't need to set this absolute path here. (SdeG)
#	See also INTERFACE_OPTS (also used after CFLAGS).
#
#INCLUDE	= -I"$(TOP0)/src/include"

#	INTERFACE_OPTS are options to CC (the C compiler) that include
#	code for X11.
#
#INTERFACE_OPTS	= -DWANT_X11

#	LDFLAGS lists the options to the C compiler for linking.
#	By default, the math library is linked.
#	You can change LDFLAGS in the system-dependent file.
#	Add "-static" for static libraries.
LDFLAGS		= -lm

###	X11 options;  these need to be defined if you want the X11
###	interface (see above).  Note that they should be blank if you
###	do not have X11.
###
###	The following is configured for X11R4 as distributed by MIT.
###	Spice3 requires the "Athena Widgets" toolkit.
#
#	X_DIR indicates the top of the X11 lib/include hierarchy; it is only
#	a convenience that is used in the following definitions.
#X_DIR	= /usr

#	INCX lists the X include directories.  This may be different between
#	MIT X11R5, X11R4, and your vendor's version of X11, though listing
#	more doesn't hurt.
#
#INCX	= -I$(X_DIR)/include -I$(X_DIR)/include/X11 -I$(X_DIR)/include/X11/Xmu -I$(X_DIR)/include/X11/Xaw

#	LIBX lists the options for linking with the X11 libraries.  Order is
#	also important.  Note that "-lXext" is an "X extensions" library
#	which is not available with all versions of X11.  If you do not have
#	it, then you do not need it (delete the following reference to it).
#
#LIBX	= -L$(X_DIR)/lib -lXaw -lXt -lXext -lXmu -lX11
LDFLAGSX	= $(LIBX) -lm

###	SPICE configuration options.  These affect what variation of spice3
###	you build.  They may be changed with minimal recompilation.
###
#	DEVICES lists the types of devices that you want to use in your
#	copy of Spice3.  For a smaller binary, reduce the number of devices.
#	Some systems may have trouble building the "bsim1" and/or "bsim2".
#	It does not make sense to remove any of cap, cccs, ccvs, ind, isrc,
#	res, vccs, vcvs, or vsrc.
#		asrc:	arbitrary voltage/current source
#		bjt:	bipolar junction transistor
#		bsim1:	MOS model
#		bsim2:	MOS model
#		cap:	capacitor
#		cccs:	current-controlled current source
#		ccvs:	current-controlled voltage source
#		csw:	current controlled switch
#		dio:	diode
#		ltra:	lossy transmission line
#		ind:	inductor
#		isrc:	current source
#		jfet:	Junction FET
#		mes:	MES FET (GaAs)
#		mos1:	MOS, simplest analytic model
#		mos2:	MOS, simplest
#		mos3:	MOS, simplest
#		mos6: 	MOS, fast analytic, short-channel
#		res:	resistor
#		sw:	switch
#		tra:	lossless transmission line
#		urc:	uniform RC line
#		vccs:	voltage-controlled current source
#		vcvs:	voltage-controlled voltage source
#		vsrc:	voltage source
#
DEVICES = asrc bjt bsim1 bsim2 bsim3 cap cccs ccvs csw dio ind isrc jfet \
	  ltra mes mos1 mos2 mos3 mos6 res sw tra urc vccs vcvs vsrc

#	ANALYSES list the analysis types that you want to have available in
#	Spice3.  As with DEVICES, this can reduce the size of the resulting
#	simulator.  Analyses op, dc, tf, ac, and tran are basic.  Analyses are:
#		op:	Operating point
#		dc:	DC transfer curve
#		tf:	Small signal transfer function
#		ac:	AC (frequency domain)
#		tran:	transient
#		pz:	pole-zero
#		disto:	distortion
#		noise:	noise
#		sense:  ac/dc all-parameter sensitivity
#
ANALYSES = op dc tf ac tran pz disto noise sense

#	SPICE_BUGADDR is the e-mail address to send bug reports.  If left blank
#	the "bug" command in spice will not operate.
#
SPICE_BUGADDR = space-support-ewi@tudelft.nl

#	SPICE_EDITOR lists where the default editor used by the "edit"
#	command is located.
SPICE_EDITOR = vi

#	SPICE_ASCIIRAWFILE indicates that the default format of the spice3 raw data
#	file should be in human-readable format ( = 1 ) or in the smaller,
#	machine-dependent binary format.
#SPICE_ASCIIRAWFILE = 1
SPICE_ASCIIRAWFILE = 0

###
###	The End.   Use the 'build' command in util/ to build spice.
