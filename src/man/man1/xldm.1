.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Xldm
is a program that extracts the complete LDM layout description
out of an ICD layout database.
A cell is known as a model in LDM.
The current working directory must be the project directory.
.PP
With the origin mode (option -x, the default is no-origin mode)
the lower-left corner of the bounding box of a sub-cell is used
as the translation vector reference point.
Note that, if the bounding box information of sub-cells in the
database is incorrect, the sub-cell data can then be incorrectly
placed, so therefore the use of this option is discouraged.
